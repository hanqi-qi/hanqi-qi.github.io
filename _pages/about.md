✨ Hi everyone! I'm a PostDoc at [King's college London](https://kcl.ac.uk/), NLP Group,led by [Prof. Yulan He](https://sites.google.com/view/yulanhe), . I passed my PhD viva with no corrections after a great time in University of Warwick (2020.10-2024.04), advised by Prof. Yulan He and Dr. Lin Gui. I finished my M.S. at Peking University and my B.E. at Beihang University.
